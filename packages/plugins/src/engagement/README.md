# `engagement` plugin

Leveling/XP with anti-farming controls, leaderboards, a reputation system, a starboard, and
temporary voice channels (SPEC.md §G subset; ARCHITECTURE.md §7.1 row `engagement`).

## What it does

### Leveling

- **Message XP**: `config.leveling.xpPerMessageMin`..`xpPerMessageMax` (default 15–25) per eligible
  message, gated by a per-user cooldown (`xpCooldownSeconds`, default 60s) and a rolling-hour cap
  (`maxXpPerHour`, default 600). Never reads message content — only that a non-bot, non-ignored
  message was sent. Ignores bots, `config.leveling.ignoredChannelIds`, and members with any role in
  `config.leveling.ignoredRoleIds`.
- **Voice XP**: `config.leveling.voiceXpPerMinute` (default 5) while a member is unmuted, undeafened,
  and non-bot in a voice channel that currently has at least 2 such members. Tracked via a Redis
  session timer per member (`voiceStateUpdate` starts/stops sessions as channel membership and
  mute state change) so partial minutes are never lost or double-counted.
- **Level formula**: `level(xp)` — cumulative XP to reach level `l` is
  `sum_{k=0}^{l-1} (5k² + 50k + 100)` (pure helpers `levelFromXp`/`xpForLevel`/`xpToNextLevel` in
  `service.ts`, unit tested for monotonicity and exact inverse behavior).
- **Level-up announcement**: `config.leveling.levelUpChannel` — `'current'` (the channel the
  triggering message/voice activity happened in), `'dm'`, `'none'`, or a channel id — using
  `config.leveling.levelUpMessage` (`{user}`/`{level}` placeholders). Settable from the dashboard or
  with `/level announce <mode> [channel]` (validates the bot can View Channel + Send Messages there
  before saving).
- **Level-role rewards** (`LevelReward`): applied automatically on level-up, and recomputable for
  every ranked member via `/level rewards sync`. `config.leveling.rewardMode` — `'stack'` grants
  every reward at or below the new level; `'replace'` keeps only the single highest-earned reward
  role, removing lower ones.
- Emits the platform `level.up` event on every level-up (message or voice).

### Reputation

- `/rep give <user> [reason]` — 1 reputation per giver per cooldown window
  (`config.rep.cooldownHours`, default 24h; enforced by a Redis `SET NX PX` on the _giver_, which
  also guarantees "at most one rep to any single target per day from the same giver" whenever the
  cooldown is 24h or more). Can't self-rep.
- `/rep check [user]`, `/rep leaderboard`, `/rep revoke <user> <amount>` (admin — writes a negative
  `ReputationEvent`, never deletes history).

### Starboard

- `messageReactionAdd`/`Remove` (partials-aware) on `config.starboard.emoji` (default ⭐). Posts to
  `config.starboard.channelId` once eligible-reactor count reaches `config.starboard.threshold`
  (default 5), updates the embed as the count changes, and removes the post if it drops back below
  threshold. Self-stars excluded by default (`config.starboard.ignoreSelfStar`); NSFW channels
  skipped unless `config.starboard.allowNsfw`. Message content is only echoed into the embed when
  the Message Content privileged intent is enabled — otherwise the embed shows author, jump link,
  and attachment count only.

### Temporary voice channels

- `config.tempVoice.hubChannelIds` — joining a hub creates a personal voice channel (name from
  `config.tempVoice.nameTemplate`, `{user}` placeholder; under `config.tempVoice.categoryId` or the
  hub's own category) and moves the member in. `TempVoiceChannel` tracks ownership.
- Owner self-service: `/tempvoice lock|unlock|limit|rename|claim|kick|permit`.
- Cleanup: deleted immediately when empty (`voiceStateUpdate`), with `engagement:tempvoice-sweep`
  (every 5 minutes) as a backstop for anything a missed gateway event or bot restart leaves orphaned.

## Config keys

See `manifest.ts`'s `configSchema` for the full shape/defaults (`leveling`, `rep`, `starboard`,
`tempVoice`); every field has a default so `configSchema.parse({})` succeeds.

## Permissions

| Permission           | Feature                                        | Optional | Fallback                                                            |

| Manage Roles         | Level-up role rewards                          | Yes      | Level-ups still announce; role grant/remove is skipped and logged.  |
| Manage Channels      | Temp voice channel create/rename/delete        | Yes      | Hub still exists; the bot can't create/manage the personal channel. |
| Move Members         | Moving the creator into their new temp channel | Yes      | Channel is still created; the member moves in manually.             |
| Send Messages        | Level-up announcements, starboard posts        | No       | Silently fails to send; nothing else breaks.                        |
| Embed Links          | Rank/leaderboard/starboard embeds              | No       | —                                                                   |
| Read Message History | Starboard reaction counts on older messages    | Yes      | May miss reactions added while the bot was offline.                 |

No privileged intents are required for the plugin to function; `MessageContent` (privileged, optional)
only upgrades the starboard embed to include a content excerpt when the guild has it enabled.

## Privacy

- Leveling stores aggregate counters only (XP, level, message count, voice minutes) — never message
  content.
- Reputation stores giver, recipient, an optional short free-text reason, and a timestamp.
- The starboard stores a link to the source message and its author; it echoes message content only
  when the Message Content intent is enabled, and only for messages members themselves starred.
- Temp voice stores the channel id, creator, and origin hub; deleted automatically once empty.

## Dashboard

`/dashboard/[guildId]/engagement` — four tabs (Leveling, Reputation, Starboard, Temp voice), all
built on `GET/PUT /guilds/:guildId/engagement/config` (one JSON blob covering every sub-feature's
settings) plus dedicated endpoints for the leaderboard, level-role rewards CRUD, an audited XP
adjustment, and the reputation leaderboard.

## Known gaps / follow-ups

- **No `ServiceMap['engagement']` entry**: `packages/plugins/src/sdk/services.ts` (owned by the SDK
  build stage) does not declare an `engagement` key, so this plugin does not call
  `ctx.services.register('engagement', ...)` — there is currently no cross-plugin consumer for one
  anyway. If a future plugin needs to call into engagement (e.g. automod granting/removing XP), add
  the key there first.
- **Dashboard XP adjustments and role rewards**: the dashboard's XP-adjust endpoint writes
  `LevelProfile` directly (no Discord round-trip). It does **not** reconcile level-role rewards for
  the member immediately, since that needs live guild/member data the API process doesn't have and
  `apps/bot/src/host/bot-actions.ts`'s `BotActionType`/`DISPATCH_TABLE` (owned by the bot-host build
  stage) has no `engagement.*` entry to enqueue that reconciliation onto. Rewards catch up the next
  time the member is active in Discord, or immediately via `/level rewards sync`.
- **Temp voice category picker** in the dashboard has no server-side channel-type filter (no
  dedicated "categories only" endpoint), so it lists every channel; picking a non-category id fails
  the eventual Discord API call rather than being blocked in the UI.
