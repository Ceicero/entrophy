# Automod

Configurable automated moderation rules — spam, mentions, invites, scam links, word/regex filters, caps, repeated
characters, attachments, NSFW-channel enforcement, new-account restrictions, and raid detection — with per-rule and
guild-wide dry-run, exemptions, cooldowns, and a false-positive review queue. Plugin id: `automod`. Enabled by
default, with dry-run on by default (SPEC.md §C; ARCHITECTURE.md §7.1).

## What it does

Every enabled rule is evaluated (in priority order) against each new message (and edited messages, for
content-dependent rules) or each new member join. A match can trigger one or more configured actions — warn,
delete, timeout, quarantine, alert staff, or just log ("ignore") — unless the user/role/channel is exempt, the
rule is on cooldown for that user, or dry-run is on (guild-wide or per-rule), in which case the match is only
logged. Every match is recorded as an `AutomodEvent`, which shows up in `/automod review` and the dashboard's
review queue until a moderator marks it **Confirm violation** or **False positive**.

Raid detection (`RAID_DETECTION`) never bans automatically. Beyond its own per-rule actions, a guild can configure
`raidLockdown` (`none` / `raise-verification` / `quarantine-new-joins`) as an additional guild-wide response to a
detected join burst.

## Rule types

| Type | What it checks | Needs Message Content intent? | Needs Guild Members intent? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MESSAGE_FREQUENCY` | Too many messages in a time window | No | No |
| `DUPLICATE_MESSAGES` | The same message repeated | Yes | No |
| `MENTION_SPAM` | Too many mentions in one message | No | No |
| `INVITE_LINKS` | Discord invite links not on the allow list | Yes | No |
| `SCAM_LINKS` | Known scam/phishing domains and bait phrases | Yes | No |
| `REGEX_FILTER` | A custom regex pattern (validated against catastrophic backtracking) | Yes | No |
| `WORD_FILTER` | A configured word/phrase list | Yes | No |
| `CAPS` | Excessive uppercase ("shouting") | Yes | No |
| `REPEATED_CHARS` | A character repeated many times in a row | Yes | No |
| `ATTACHMENTS` | Blocked file extensions / too many attachments | Yes | No |
| `NSFW_ENFORCEMENT` | Keywords outside an NSFW-marked channel | No\* | No |
| `ACCOUNT_AGE` | New accounts under a minimum age, on join | No | Yes |
| `RAID_DETECTION` | A burst of joins within a time window | No | Yes |

\* `NSFW_ENFORCEMENT` doesn't *require* the Message Content intent to stay "active", but its keyword matching is a
no-op without it (Discord doesn't deliver message text to the bot otherwise).

A rule whose required privileged intent isn't enabled shows as **inactive: requires `<intent>`** in
`/automod rule list`, `/automod rule view`, `/automod status`, and the dashboard, rather than silently failing.

## Commands

All commands require at least `helper` staff level (or an equivalent Discord permission); `rule create/edit/
delete/toggle` and `exempt add/remove` additionally require `moderator`; `dryrun` requires `admin`.

- `/automod rule create <type> <name> <action> [timeout_minutes]` — opens a form for the rule's type-specific settings
- `/automod rule list` — every rule, with status
- `/automod rule view <rule>` — full configuration
- `/automod rule edit <rule>` — opens a prefilled form for the type-specific settings
- `/automod rule delete <rule>` — soft-deletes, with confirmation
- `/automod rule toggle <rule>` — enable/disable
- `/automod rule test <rule> <text>` — dry-runs the rule's evaluator against sample text, no action taken
- `/automod exempt add|remove <rule> <kind> [role|channel|user|domain]` — per-rule exemptions
- `/automod exempt list <rule>` — a rule's current exemptions
- `/automod dryrun <on|off>` — guild-wide dry-run switch (admin)
- `/automod review` — pending-event queue with **Confirm violation** / **False positive** buttons
- `/automod status` — dry-run state, rule health, recent activity

## Config keys (`/config set automod.<key>` or the dashboard)

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `dryRun` | `true` | Guild-wide; ORed with each rule's own `dryRun` |
| `alertChannelId` | `null` | Where the "alert staff" action and review-queue embeds post |
| `quarantineRoleId` | `null` | Role assigned by the "quarantine" action and raid lockdown |
| `exemptStaff` | `true` | Members at/above `helper` staff level are exempt from every rule |
| `defaultTimeoutMs` | `600000` (10m) | Used when a "timeout" action doesn't specify its own duration |
| `raidLockdown` | `'none'` | `none` / `raise-verification` / `quarantine-new-joins` |
| `raidLockdownMinutes` | `15` | Duration of a `quarantine-new-joins` lockdown |

## Permissions (why, and fallback if missing)

| Permission | Feature | Optional | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| View Channel | reading messages, posting alerts | No | Rules never fire in that channel |
| Send Messages | alert/review embeds | No | Alerts fail to send; matches are still logged |
| Embed Links | alert/review embeds | No | Alerts post as plain text |
| Manage Messages | the "delete" action | Yes | Matches are logged, not deleted |
| Timeout Members (Moderate Members) | the "timeout" action | Yes | Matches are logged, not timed out |
| Manage Roles | "quarantine" action + raid-lockdown quarantine | Yes | Logged, role not assigned |
| Manage Server | raising verification level during a raid lockdown | Yes | That lockdown option is skipped |

No privileged intent is required for the plugin to load — `MessageContent`/`GuildMembers` unlock the
content/member-dependent rule types above; without them, those specific rules show as inactive.

## Privacy

- A matched rule's excerpt is stored on its `AutomodEvent` only when the guild has enabled
  `GuildConfig.logMessageContent`; otherwise only metadata (rule, user, channel, action) is recorded.
- Content-dependent rules only evaluate message text when the Message Content intent is enabled.
- Regex filters are validated for catastrophic-backtracking risk before they can be saved (`validateUserRegex`),
  and matching always runs against truncated input (`safeTest`).
- Raid detection never bans automatically.
- `AutomodEvent` rows are purged per-guild by an hourly job, honoring `DataRetentionPolicy.automodEventDays`
  (default 90 days).

## Dashboard

`/dashboard/[guildId]/automod` — rule list with type badges and enabled/dry-run switches, a create/edit form
driven by the rule's type, an actions builder, an exemptions editor, a guild-wide dry-run banner, a review-queue
tab, and a settings tab.
