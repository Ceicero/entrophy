/**
 * Keeps the Enforcer mute-role deny-overwrites in sync as new channels appear, without waiting for a manual
 * `/enforcer setup repair:true` (ARCHITECTURE.md §19): a channel created after the mute role was set up would
 * otherwise silently let muted members send/speak/react in it until someone remembers to repair. Applies to
 * every channel type the bulk apply covers (text, voice, announcement, forum, stage) plus categories — a
 * category can hold its own overwrites, so applying there means channels created under it inherit the deny too.
 *
 * `channelCreate`'s payload type (`NonThreadGuildBasedChannel`) already rules out threads and DM channels, so no
 * runtime check is needed for those; `!channel.isThread()` below is kept only as defensive documentation,
 * matching `applyMuteRoleToChannels`'s own filter in `../channels.ts`.
 *
 * Plugin-enablement ("if enforcer is enabled for the guild") is handled by the host's automatic `guildIdOf`
 * gating (see `apps/bot/src/host/loader.ts`), the same convention every other event handler in this plugin uses
 * (e.g. `./message-create.ts`) — this handler does not re-check `ctx.isEnabled` itself.
 *
 * Best-effort only: any failure (missing Manage Roles/Manage Channels, a role deleted out from under us, a
 * transient API error) is logged at `warn` and swallowed — a single bad apply must never throw out of the
 * listener and take down other plugins' `channelCreate` handlers.
